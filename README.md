BioHub is a unified, scalable, and professional platform designed to revolutionize biosafety, biostasis management, IoT monitoring, outbreak surveillance, and incident reporting. The project aligns closely with the objectives of the **Heartland BioWorks Hub (HBW)**, fostering collaboration among academia, industry, and government stakeholders.

## Features
- **Biosafety**: Manage and monitor biosafety records, aligned with the HBW BioTrain initiative.
- **Biostasis**: Track and analyze biostasis data, supporting workforce and technical innovations.
- **IoT Monitoring**: Integrate IoT devices for real-time monitoring, addressing HBW's BioLaunch goals.
- **Outbreak Surveillance**: Record and review outbreak events to strengthen regional biotech infrastructure.
- **Incident Reporting**: Log and track incidents effectively, contributing to HBWâ€™s broader impact goals.

## HBW Membership Alignment
This platform supports the following principles outlined in the Heartland BioWorks Membership Agreement:
1. **Collaboration**: Enables stakeholders to share data and insights, fostering innovation.
2. **Governance**: Integrates workflows compatible with HBW's management boards (Executive, Scientific, Community Equity).
3. **Training and Development**: Facilitates entry-level workforce training and project tracking as part of the BioTrain initiative.
