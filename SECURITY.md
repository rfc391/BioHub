# üîê BioHub Security Overview

This document outlines the high-grade security protocols in BioHub, intended for secure military, paramilitary, and airgapped use.

## Security Features

- GPG + SSH RSA based authentication
- Local-only service exposure (no cloud APIs)
- File-system access logging (via auditd & fail2ban)
- Hardened Docker container with minimal base image
- Encrypted config files using GPG
- Optional mTLS enforcement between internal components
- Self-healing watchdogs via Monit
- Optional biometric key support (future)

## Authentication

Use only SSH and GPG keys. Do not expose the web interface publicly.

## File Permissions

Use `chown` and `chmod` to limit execution, read, and write access.
